### Provisioning a Keycloak server

If you already have access to a Keycloak server you can skip this section. &#x20;

{% tab title="Managed Keycloak instance" %}
Don't want to deploy and maintain a own Keycloak server yourself?&#x20;

Choosing Keycloak as a Service through a cloud IAM provider can offload the complexities of management and maintenance. It ensures that your system is always up-to-date with the latest security patches and features without the direct overhead of server upkeep. This is especially beneficial for teams prioritizing development and innovation over infrastructure management, offering robust support and service level agreements to guarantee smooth operation. &#x20;

### Configuring your Keycloak server

Let's configure your Keycloak server with good default for an SPA.&#x20;

Connect to the admin panel of your Keycloak server (we assumes it's https://auth.my-domain.net/auth)

* Create a realm called "myrealm" (or something else), go to **Realm settings**
  1. On the tab General
     1. _User Profile Enabled_: **On**
  2. On the tab **login**
     1. _User registration_: **On**
     2. _Forgot password_: **On**
     3. _Remember me_: **On**
  3. On the tab **email,** we give an example with [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), if you don't have a SMTP server at hand you can skip this by going to **Authentication** (on the left panel) -> Tab **Required Actions** -> Uncheck "set as default action" **Verify Email**. Be aware that with email verification disable, anyone will be able to sign up to your service.
     1. _From_: **noreply@my-domain.net**
     2. _Host_: **email-smtp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com**
     3. _Port_: **465**
     4. _Authentication_: **enabled**
     5. _Username_: **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
     6. _Password_: **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
     7. When clicking "save" you'll be asked for a test email, you have to provide one that correspond **to a pre-existing user** or you will get a silent error and the credentials won't be saved.
  4. On the tab Themes. See [Keycloakify](https://www.keycloakify.dev/) for creating a Keycloak theme that match your webapp.
  5. On the tab **Localization**
     1. _Internationalization_: **Enabled**
     2. _Supported locales_: \<Select the languages you wish to support>
  6. On the tab **Sessions**
     1. SSO Session Idle: **14 days** - This is where you configure the auto logout policy. If you want your user to be automatically loged out after **30 minutes**, set it here.
     2. SSO Session Max: **14 days**
     3. SSO Session Idle Remember Me: **365 days** - Same than SSO Session Idle but when the user have checked "Remember me" when login in. If you have enaled "remeber me" and you want this option to make sens you must set it to a value that is greater than SSO Session Idle. If you have set SSO Session Idle to something short because you want to implement an auto logout policy you probably want to go in Realm -> login and disable "Remember me"
     4. SSO Session Max Remember Me: **365 days** - Same note here.
*   Create a new OpenID Connect client called "myclient" (or something else) by accessing Clients -> Create Client

    1. _Root URL_: **https://your-domain.net** (or something else, your app does not need to be on the&#x20;

    the same domain as your Keycloak).

    1. _Valid redirect URIs_: **https://onyxia.my-domain.net/\*, http://localhost\* (for testing in local)**
    2. _Web origins_: **\***
    3. Login theme: keycloak (or your theme if you have one)
* (OPTIONAL) In **Authentication** (on the left panel) -> Tab **Required Actions** enable and set as default action **Therms and Conditions.** (You can use Keycloakify to specify your therme and condition, see next section)
* (OPTIONAL) On the left pannel you can go to identity provider to enable login via Google, GitHub, Instagram, ect...&#x20;
*   (OPTIONAL) Enable your user to delete their own account (see [user account managment](../documentation/user-account-management.md))

    1. In the left bar navigate to **Autentication** -> **Required Action** -> "**Delete Account**" Enabled: **On**
    2. In the left bar navigate to **Realm Setting** -> **User Registration** -> **Default Roles** -> **Assign Role** -> **Filter by client** -> select **Delete Account** and click on assign.



{% hint style="success" %}
Now the parameter that you will have to provide to oidc-spa are:&#x20;

```
    issuerUri: "https://auth.your-domain.net/realms/myrealm",
    clientId: "myclient"
```

Replace `your-domain.net`, `myrealm` and `myclient` by what you actually used in the configuration process.\
(On older Keycloak the issuerUri will be "https://auth.your-domain.net/**auth**/realms/myrealm")
{% endhint %}
